# mobydig
Image to run Sysdig on Docker for mac (but not only, it should work on a docker engine on a linux host)
#Why ?
Why a particular image for Docker for mac ?
Sysdig provides a Docker image to run sysdig/csysdig on Docker but on a Linux host. As the sources os Docker for mac are not yet avaliable, there is no easy way to use the DKMS build capability of the upstream image. Finally, I could not just publish an image to the Docker Hub as kernel are upgraded often on Docker for mac.

Why that name ?
Because some difficulties to reach my target comes from the fact that Docker for mac named the kernel linux-4.4.x-moby. And that particular name had me to search for a few trick on compiling kernel libs, so it's gonna be like a souvenir every time I get back to this project.

# Get it, build it

    # git clone https://github.com/fdebonneval/mobydig.git
    # cd mobydig
    # make build

Build time is around 15 minutes with a decent internet access and my i5 MBP.
After the build, the image is published in your local registry with the name `mobydig:(sysdig verion)`
You can choose the tag/branch you want to build against by changing the VERSION variable in the Makefile

# And run it
To run csysdig, the great htop like ncurses tool, just use

    # make csysdig

To run sysdig, use 

    # make sysdig

# Todo
* Reduce image size. I gave a try to Alpine, but it seem there is an issue around Libc
* Fix mouse inputs in spectro view
* Write some examples
